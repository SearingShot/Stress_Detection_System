# Real-Time Facial Emotion Detection and Stress Detection

## Overview:

This repository contains the source code for a Real-Time Facial Emotion Detection and Stress Detection system. The system utilizes deep learning algorithms to detect facial emotions and Detects Stress based on real-time webcam feed.

## Instructions:

- **Model Retraining (Optional):** Run the provided Jupyter Notebook (`Stress_Detection.ipynb`) file to retrain the model. This step is necessary only if you wish to train the model with a new dataset or modify the existing one.
- **Running the Application:** Run the `Main.py` file to start the Flask application for real-time emotion detection and Stress Detection. Ensure that the necessary dependencies are installed before running the application.
- **Dataset Link:** The dataset used for training the model can be found at [DataSet](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/utsavsharma27/emotion-detection-system). You can download the dataset and use it for retraining the model if needed.

## Technologies Used:

- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
- MobileNet architecture for deep learning
- Haar Cascade Classifier for face detection
- OpenCV for image processing tasks
- Flask for local server deployment

## Usage:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required Libraries like OpenCV, TensorFlow, Flask, etc.
3. If you want to retrain the model, run the Jupyter Notebook file (`Stress_Detection.ipynb`) and follow the instructions provided.
4. Once the model is trained or if you want to use the pre-trained model, run `Main.py` to start the Flask application.
5. Access the application through the provided URL and interact with the real-time facial emotion detection and Stress Detection System.

## Results:

- Not Stressed
